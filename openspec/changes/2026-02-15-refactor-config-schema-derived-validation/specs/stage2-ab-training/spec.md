## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Stage-2 AB canonical rollout namespace is normalized before trainer injection
Stage-2 AB canonical profile authoring MUST use a grouped rollout namespace outside `custom.extra`, and loader/runtime MUST normalize this namespace into the trainer-consumed rollout config through a schema-derived strict parsing path.

Normative behavior additions:
- Config shape validation for Stage-2 profiles MUST be driven by typed schema contracts (dataclass field definitions), not duplicated manual nested allowlists in multiple modules.
- Unknown keys MUST fail fast with full dotted-path errors during config load before trainer construction.
- Legacy Stage-2 rollout keys under `custom.extra.rollout_matching.*` remain unsupported and MUST fail fast with actionable migration guidance to `rollout_matching.*`.
- Runtime trainer validators MAY enforce runtime-dependent invariants, but MUST NOT be the primary owner of static config shape/key acceptance.
- Removed Stage-2 Channel-B knobs MUST fail fast at config-load time:
  - `stage2_ab.channel_b.reordered_gt_sft`
  - `stage2_ab.channel_b.desc_ce_weight_matched`
  - `stage2_ab.channel_b.semantic_desc_gate`
- `src/sft.py` rollout normalization/injection path remains authoritative for trainer wiring:
  - normalized top-level `rollout_matching` is injected as `rollout_matching_cfg`,
  - parser refactor MUST NOT alter this injection contract semantics.
- Launcher preflight JSON contract defined for Stage-2 canonical rollout normalization remains required:
  - Python resolver emits shell assignment lines; the `ROLLOUT_CONTRACT_JSON` value MUST be newline-terminated single-line JSON,
  - required keys/types: `rollout_backend` (string), `vllm_mode` (string or null), `server_base_urls` (array of strings),
  - invalid/missing JSON contract fields MUST fail fast before launch.
- The 3-key JSON contract above is the minimum normative contract; additional preflight payload keys are allowed but MUST NOT weaken or replace the minimum contract.
- For `custom.trainer_variant=stage2_ab_training`, top-level `rollout_matching` remains required and missing it MUST fail fast.

#### Scenario: Unknown nested rollout key fails at schema load
- **WHEN** a Stage-2 AB config defines `rollout_matching.vllm.server.servers[0].unknown_flag`
- **THEN** config loading fails fast before trainer init
- **AND** the error reports a full nested path including list index (e.g., `rollout_matching.vllm.server.servers[0].unknown_flag`).

#### Scenario: Runtime validator does not own static key allowlists
- **WHEN** schema parsing succeeds for canonical rollout keys
- **THEN** trainer initialization does not require duplicate static unknown-key allowlist ownership for the same config shape.

#### Scenario: sft injection contract remains stable
- **WHEN** canonical rollout config is valid and loaded
- **THEN** `src/sft.py` injects normalized rollout config into trainer `rollout_matching_cfg`
- **AND** parser architecture changes do not require alternate rollout source paths.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Stage-2 config sections are parsed by schema-derived strict contracts
Stage-2 training config loading MUST enforce unknown-key fail-fast across all top-level sections using schema-derived strict parsing.

Normative section coverage:
- `model`
- `quantization`
- `template`
- `data`
- `tuner`
- `training`
- `rlhf`
- `custom`
- `debug`
- `stage2_ab`
- `rollout_matching`
- `deepspeed`
- `global_max_length`
- `extra` (reserved/rejected at top-level)

Normative behavior:
- The loader MUST derive accepted keys from typed section contracts.
- Any unsupported key in any covered section MUST fail fast with full dotted-path key reporting.
- Semantic/value constraints (range checks, required combinations) MUST remain enforced after shape validation.
- Explicit schema extension buckets remain allowed only where declared by contract (currently `custom.extra`).
- Extension-bucket allowance MUST NOT relax strictness for canonical grouped sections.
- Top-level `extra:` is not an author-facing extension bucket; presence of top-level `extra:` MUST fail fast.
- Section-coverage entry `extra` means loader-level explicit detection/rejection ownership; it does not permit arbitrary top-level `extra` payload parsing.
- Dotted-path unknown-key reporting format MUST include list indices where applicable (`field[index].subfield`).
- Regression verification MUST include fixture coverage for:
  - strict `custom.extra` policy behavior,
  - Stage-2 smoke/profile configs using canonical top-level `rollout_matching.*`,
  - `stage2_ab_training` requirement for top-level `rollout_matching`.

#### Scenario: Unknown top-level section key fails fast
- **WHEN** a config includes an unsupported top-level key under canonical Stage-2 profile loading
- **THEN** loader fails fast and reports the unknown key.

#### Scenario: Unknown key inside covered section fails fast
- **WHEN** a config includes `custom.unknown_knob`
- **THEN** loader fails fast and reports `custom` section unknown-key details.

#### Scenario: Removed Channel-B semantic-desc gate key fails fast
- **WHEN** a config includes `stage2_ab.channel_b.semantic_desc_gate`
- **THEN** loader fails fast before trainer init
- **AND** error includes dotted path `stage2_ab.channel_b.semantic_desc_gate`
- **AND** error message indicates removed-or-unknown key with actionable removal guidance.

#### Scenario: Removed Channel-B reordered-gt key fails fast
- **WHEN** a config includes `stage2_ab.channel_b.reordered_gt_sft`
- **THEN** loader fails fast before trainer init
- **AND** error includes dotted path `stage2_ab.channel_b.reordered_gt_sft`
- **AND** error message indicates removed-or-unknown key with actionable removal guidance.

#### Scenario: Removed Channel-B desc-ce-weight key fails fast
- **WHEN** a config includes `stage2_ab.channel_b.desc_ce_weight_matched`
- **THEN** loader fails fast before trainer init
- **AND** error includes dotted path `stage2_ab.channel_b.desc_ce_weight_matched`
- **AND** error message indicates removed-or-unknown key with actionable removal guidance.

#### Scenario: Extension bucket accepts minor residual keys
- **WHEN** a config includes `custom.extra.some_minor_toggle`
- **THEN** config loading can succeed if all canonical grouped sections remain valid.

#### Scenario: Top-level extra presence fails fast
- **WHEN** a config includes top-level `extra:` (including empty `{}`)
- **THEN** config loading fails fast with guidance that only `custom.extra` is the escape-hatch bucket.

#### Scenario: Missing top-level rollout_matching still fails for stage2_ab_training
- **WHEN** `custom.trainer_variant=stage2_ab_training` and top-level `rollout_matching` is omitted
- **THEN** config loading fails fast with actionable requirement text for top-level `rollout_matching`.

#### Scenario: Preflight contract format is strict
- **WHEN** launcher preflight emits contract JSON
- **THEN** the `ROLLOUT_CONTRACT_JSON` value contains the minimum 3-key contract as newline-terminated single-line JSON
- **AND** malformed format or missing required keys fails fast before launch.

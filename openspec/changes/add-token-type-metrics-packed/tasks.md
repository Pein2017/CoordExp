## TODO
- [x] Read proposal and relevant prior change `add-vl-packing-wrapper`; confirm packing behavior expectations for eval.
- [x] Add config schema/plumbing for `token_type_metrics` (enabled/include/exclude defaults to lvis only) and thread into sft/custom config.
- [x] Port collator helper (dataset labels + token_types) and adapt to aggregate-only metrics; ensure NaN-safe when no supervised tokens.
- [x] Implement packing-aware token-type alignment (pre-pack compute + concat) and gate logging when alignment fails.
- [x] Add trainer mixin wiring in sft (train/eval), respecting packing toggle; disable per-dataset telemetry.
- [x] Add tests: unit for compute_token_types, collator attaches token_types (padded), packed alignment correctness, NaN-safe empty supervision.
- [x] Update docs to describe feature, defaults, and packed-vs-eval behavior.
- [x] Run `openspec validate add-token-type-metrics-packed --strict` and project tests relevant to new code.
- [ ] Record PORTING note vs Qwen3-VL (aggregate-only, metric keys) and capture intentional deltas.
- [ ] Add contract/compat test for include/exclude with packed mixed datasets and for packed misalignment skip path.
